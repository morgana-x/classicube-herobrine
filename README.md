# classicube-herobrine
A sloppy mess of code that I used to figure out how Classicube plugins work

(Not at all supposed to be a polished plugin!)

this plugin SLOWLY will GRIEF your server, (creepy crosses in the ground, probably should just make it do it once only)
```
/punload herobrine (if updating)
/pcompile herobrine
/pload herobrine
```
