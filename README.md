# classicube-herobrine
A sloppy mess of code that I used to figure out how Classicube plugins work (Not at all supposed to be a polished plugin!)

Emulates that old creepy pasta, subtle, almost unnoticable yet, unnerving experience

this plugin SLOWLY will GRIEF your server, (creepy crosses in the ground, probably should just make it do it once only) (You can disable this by looking through the code and setting `AllowGrief` to false

# Setup
Paste Herobrine.cs in your classicube server's plugin folder
```
/punload herobrine (if updating) (You will need to resummon herobrine on reloading)
/pcompile herobrine
/pload herobrine
```

# How to summon
Summoning can only happen once per server session / until plugin reloaded
+ Place a mossy rock block
+ Surround that block with gold blocks
+ Place a magma block on top of the mossy rock block
+ Place fire on top of the magma block
