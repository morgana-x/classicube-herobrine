# classicube-herobrine
A sloppy mess of code that I used to figure out how Classicube plugins work

(Not at all supposed to be a polished plugin!)

this plugin SLOWLY will GRIEF your server, (creepy crosses in the ground, probably should just make it do it once only) (You can disable this by looking through the code and setting `AllowGrief` to false
```
/punload herobrine (if updating)
/pcompile herobrine
/pload herobrine
```
